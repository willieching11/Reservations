# Reservations
In Class Project - Node/Express

Bonus:

If by some miracle you finish early, feel encouraged to work on any one of these additional tasks to take your application to the next level.

Add code to your server so that it "counts" every time a person visits any of the pages. Display a running count on the website.

Add buttons for "checking off" individuals from the reservation list. Once this happens, the next person on the waitlist should be addd to the main reservation list.

Add a button for sending emails to individuals on the wait-list letting them know they have a table ready. You will need to use node-mailer or a similar npm package to make this work. (A hard task, but very cool).

Add a button for sending text messages to individuals on the wait-list letting them know they have a table ready. You will need to use the Twilio library to make this work. (A hard task, but very cool).

Phase I: For this first phase, aim to write out the pieces that will need to be programmed to create the functionality of your application. Try to break it into 6-7 pieces.
Instructors/TAs: Once time is up have students share their breakdowns. As a suggestion, here is a list that you can slack them.

Create the front-end (visuals) for home page, reservation form, and reservation views.

Create a basic server using Express.JS

Create a few array variables that will hold the data

Create a set of routes for getting and posting table data

Create a set of routes for displaying the HTML pages

Use jQuery to run AJAX calls to GET and POST data from users to the Express server

Phase II: For this second phase, aim to complete the following:

Backend Team:

Create a basic Express server.

Your server at this point should do the BARE MINIMUM. (Effectively, it should just say: "Listening at PORT 3000" when the command node server.js is run.)

Frontend Team:

Create three HTML files one called home.html, another called tables.html, and another called reserve.html. Use dummy data and create pages similar to the one shown to you on the sample Hot Reservation webpage.
All: If you finish early, begin thinking about how the Data, API, and Routes should look.
